The facts\r\nthat A lived in several houses successively each of which he insured, in each of which a fire occurred,\r\nand after each of which fires A received payment from a different insurance company, are relevant, as\r\ntending to show that the fires were not accidental.</br><hr class=\"hr1\"/>\r\n<span style=\"margin-left:15px;\"></span>(b) A is employed to receive money from the debtors of B. It is A's duty to make entries in a book\r\nshowing the amounts received by him. He makes an entry showing that on a particular occasion he\r\nreceived less than he really did receive. The question is, whether this false entry was accidental or\r\nintentional.

The question is, whether the\r\ndelivery of the currency was accidental.
