Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls\nin and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be\nlikely to cause Z\u2019s death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.

Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes\nhim with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder,\nalthough the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a\nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him\nsuch a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A,\nalthough he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death,\nor such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the\nordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have\nintended to cause Z's death.\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is\nguilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.\nException 1.\n---Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of\nself-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or\ncauses the death of any other person by mistake or accident:\nProvided that the provocation is not,---\n(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any\nperson;\n(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise\nof the powers of such public servant;\n(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\nExplanation\n.---Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence\nfrom amounting to murder is a question of fact.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y,\nZ's child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of\nthe child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither\nintending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here\nA has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest,\nand kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public\nservant in the exercise of his powers.\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's\ndeposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z.\nThis is murder.\n(e) A attempts to pull Zs nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to\nprevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z.\nThis is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of\nprivate defence.\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take\nadvantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z\nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\nException\n2.---Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nIllustration.\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol.\nZ persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from\nbeing horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.\nException 3.---Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is\ncaused.\nException 4.---Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offenders having taken undue\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.---It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first\nassault.\nException 5.---Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\nIllustration.\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he\nwas incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.",

A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes\nthe boat to drift down the stream.

A lashes Z\u2019s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here\nA has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used\nforce to Z; and if A has done this without Z\u2019s consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may\nthereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A\nhas caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used\nforce to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z\u2019s consent, in order to the commission of an\noffence. A has used criminal force to Z.\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his\nown person so as to bring it into contact with Z.

Here A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so\nwithout her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her,\nhe has used criminal force to her.\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by\nhis own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or\nwith other water so situated that such contact must affect Z\u2019s sense of feeling; A has therefore\nintentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\u2019s consent intending or knowing it to be\nlikely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force.\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\u2019s consent.

A, in order to defraud B, adds\ncipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote\nthe letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A, without Z\u2019s authority, affixes Z\u2019s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an\nestate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the\npurchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been\ninserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A\ncommits forgery.\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable\nand authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the\npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of\ntwenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\u2019s authority, intending to\ndiscount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B,\nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f) Z\u2019s will contains these words\u2014\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided\nbetween A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B\u2019s name, intending that it may be believed that the\nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on\nthe bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words\n\u201cPay to Z or his order\u201d, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B\ncommits forgery.\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a\nconveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z,\nintending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has\ncommitted forgery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named\nby Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to\nsign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\u2019s name without B\u2019s authority, certifying that A is a man of\ngood character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such\nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons.

A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to\ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract\nfor service.\nExplanation\n1.\u2014A man\u2019s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was\ndrawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\u2019s name, in order that B may\nafterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it\nhad been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper\npursuant to A\u2019s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A\nendorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person\nto whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate,\nin collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates\nthe lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the\nlease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery\nby antedating it.\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\u2019s benefit, and with intent to\ndefraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding\nhimself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to\nhave been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of\nthe definition.\nExplanation\n2.\u2014The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be\nbelieved that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it\nto be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.\nIllustration.\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of\nsuch fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.

Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes\nhim with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder,\nalthough the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a\nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him\nsuch a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A,\nalthough he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death,\nor such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the\nordinary course of nature.

A is\nguilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.\nException 1.\n---Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of\nself-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or\ncauses the death of any other person by mistake or accident:\nProvided that the provocation is not,---\n(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any\nperson;\n(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise\nof the powers of such public servant;\n(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\nExplanation\n.---Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence\nfrom amounting to murder is a question of fact.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y,\nZ's child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of\nthe child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither\nintending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here\nA has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest,\nand kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public\nservant in the exercise of his powers.\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's\ndeposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z.\nThis is murder.\n(e) A attempts to pull Zs nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to\nprevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z.\nThis is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of\nprivate defence.\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take\nadvantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z\nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\nException\n2.---Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the\nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the\ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and\nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nIllustration.\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol.\nZ persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from\nbeing horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.\nException 3.---Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a\npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and\ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due\ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is\ncaused.\nException 4.---Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offenders having taken undue\nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.---It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first\nassault.\nException 5.---Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\nIllustration.\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he\nwas incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.",

A has therefore used\nforce to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z\u2019s consent, in order to the commission of an\noffence. A has used criminal force to Z.\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his\nown person so as to bring it into contact with Z.

A, in order to defraud B, adds\ncipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote\nthe letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A, without Z\u2019s authority, affixes Z\u2019s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an\nestate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the\npurchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been\ninserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A\ncommits forgery.\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable\nand authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the\npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of\ntwenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\u2019s authority, intending to\ndiscount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A\ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B,\nand thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f) Z\u2019s will contains these words\u2014\"I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided\nbetween A, B and C.\" A dishonestly scratches out B\u2019s name, intending that it may be believed that the\nwhole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery.\n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on\nthe bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words\n\u201cPay to Z or his order\u201d, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B\ncommits forgery.\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a\nconveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z,\nintending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has\ncommitted forgery.\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named\nby Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to\nsign the will. A has committed forgery.\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\u2019s name without B\u2019s authority, certifying that A is a man of\ngood character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such\nletter to obtain alms from Z and other persons.

A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to\ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract\nfor service.\nExplanation\n1.\u2014A man\u2019s signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was\ndrawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\u2019s name, in order that B may\nafterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it\nhad been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper\npursuant to A\u2019s intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A\nendorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person\nto whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate,\nin collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates\nthe lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the\nlease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery\nby antedating it.\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\u2019s benefit, and with intent to\ndefraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding\nhimself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to\nhave been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of\nthe definition.\nExplanation\n2.\u2014The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be\nbelieved that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it\nto be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.\nIllustration.\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of\nsuch fictitious person with intent to negotiate it.

It is proved that he was in possession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same time, he was in possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending to show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen.\n(b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit currency is relevant. The fact that A had been previously convicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit currency knowing it to be counterfeit is\nrelevant.\n(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious. The fact that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant.\n(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the name of the payee\nwas fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have\nbeen transmitted to him by the payee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that A\nknew that the payee was a fictitious person.\n(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B. The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm B's reputation by the particular publication in question. The facts that there was no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter complained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to harm the reputation of B.\n(f) A is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby B, being induced to\ntrust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at the time when A represented C to be solvent, C\nwas supposed to be solvent by his neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing\nthat A made the representation in good faith.\n(g) A is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is owner, by the order\nof C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with C. The fact that A paid C for the work in\nquestion is relevant, as proving that A did, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in\nquestion, so that C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent for A.\n(h) A is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found, and the question\nis whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith that the real owner could not be found. The\nfact that public notice of the loss of the property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as\nshowing that A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could not be found. The\nfact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was given fraudulently by C, who had heard of\nthe loss of the property and wished to set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A\nknew of the notice did not disprove A's good faith.\n(i) A is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's intent, the fact of A's\nhaving previously shot at B may be proved.\n(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously sent by A to B\nmay be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.\n(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife. Expressions of their\nfeeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts.\n(l) The question is, whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements made by A during his illness\nas to his symptoms are relevant facts.\n(m) The question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when an assurance on his life was\neffected. Statements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the time in question are relevant\nfacts.\n(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a car for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereby A\nwas injured. The fact that B's attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular car is\nrelevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the cars which he let to hire is irrelevant.\n(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead. The fact that A on other\noccasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B. The fact that A was in the habit of\nshooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant.\n(p) A is tried for a crime. The fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that\nparticular crime is relevant. The fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit\ncrimes of that class is irrelevant.",
