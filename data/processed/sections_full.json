Here A is not\nguilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and therefore the\ncase falls within the general exception which provides that \"nothing is an offence which is done by a\nperson who is bound by law to do it\".\n(2) Every expression which is explained in any Part of this Sanhita, is used in every Part of this\nSanhita in conformity with the explanation.\n(3) When property is in the possession of a person's spouse, clerk or servant, on account of that\nperson, it is in that person's possession within the meaning of this Sanhita.\nExplanation.\n---A person employed temporarily or on a particular occasion in the capacity of a clerk\nor servant, is a clerk or servant within the meaning of this sub-section.\n(4) In every Part of this Sanhita, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words\nwhich refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions.\n(5) When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,\neach of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.\n(6) Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or\nintention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or\nintention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge\nor intention.\n(7) Wherever the causing of a certain effect, or an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an\nomission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by\nan omission is the same offence.\nIllustration.\nA intentionally causes Zs death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and partly by beating Z.\nA has committed murder.\n(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally cooperates in the\ncommission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person,\ncommits that offence.\nIllustrations.\n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison.\nA and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the\neffects the several doses of poison so administered to him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the\ncommission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty\nof the offence though their acts are separate.\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours\nat a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death, knowingly cooperate in causing that effect by illegally\nomitting, each during the time of his attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.\nZ dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z.\n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death, illegally omits to\nsupply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not\nsufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or\ncooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is likely thereby to cause Z's\ndeath. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an\nattempt to commit murder.\n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be\nguilty of different offences by means of that act.\nIllustration.\nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would be only\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and\nnot having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged\nin causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.",

Here, though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be\npunished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had\ncommitted murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness of mind,\nbeing incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets\nfire to the house in consequence of A's instigation.

Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily\ncausing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating.\nIf A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow.\nBut he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.\n(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to\nY is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for\nvoluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y.",
